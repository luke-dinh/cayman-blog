## Digital Image Processing with MATLAB
*A small project when I worked at my teacher's lab at HCMC University of Technology*
[https://github.com/luke-dinh/Image-Processing-with-Matlab](https://github.com/luke-dinh/Image-Processing-with-Matlab)
* **Time**: Sep 2019 - Oct 2019.
* **Role**: Individual.
* **Description**: I applied some Image Processing techniques in MATLAB to process image and create a new filter based on knowledge learned from the course "Digital Image Processing".
* **Target**: New images after using traditional filters and constructing a new filter. 
* **Language**: MATLAB.

## LZW Image Compression Technique
[https://github.com/luke-dinh/LZW-Technique](https://github.com/luke-dinh/LZW-Technique)
* **Time**: Oct 2019 - Nov 2019.
* **Role**: Leader, Algorithm Developer, Programming.
* **Description**: This was my final project with 2 classmates in the course "Digital Image Processing". Our work was developing and programming the LZW Image (Data) Compression Technique using Python.
* **Target**: A program that could compress the image for easier transmission.
* **Language**: Python.

## Bottle - Checking 
*Our team's final project in Computer Vision classes*
[https://github.com/luke-dinh/Bottle-checking](https://github.com/luke-dinh/Bottle-checking)
* **Time**: Sep 2019 -- Dec 2019
* **Role**: Member of a team of 4 members, in which, I were responsible for building algorithms and theory.
* **Description**: The aim of the project was to construct a system that could check whether the labels and the liquid level of the product are qualified or not. The project included Image Processing and some Machine Learning techniques such as Otsu Thresholding, Object detection, etc.
* **Result**: The system was able to check the labels and the liquid level corectly. 
* **Language**: Python.

## Object Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network
[https://github.com/luke-dinh/Convolutional-Neural-Network](https://github.com/luke-dinh/Convolutional-Neural-Network)
* **Time**: April 2020 -- May 2020.
* **Role**: Leader, Programming.
* **Description**: Our teamâ€™s small project in the course "Artificial Intelligence in Control Engineering". I constructed the architecture of 3 types of CNN: VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50 and used them for Object Recognition Problem.
* **Target**: Comparing the accuracy of results trained by three models above.
* **Language**: Python + OpenCV, Keras/Tensorflow.

## Image Super - Resolution using Deep Learning Techniques
*Major Project - Bachelor thesis*
[https://github.com/luke-dinh/Image-Super-Resolution](https://github.com/luke-dinh/Image-Super-Resolution)
* **Time**: Jan 2020 - now.
* **Role**: Individual.
* **Description**: I am researching about Deep Learning approaches in Single Image Super Resolution field. I am reading about Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) and constructing a model to solve the problem.
* **Target**: A Deep Learning model creating a new image with high resolution from a low resolution counterpart. 
* **Language**: Python + PyTorch/Keras.
