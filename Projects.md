## Image Processing with MATLAB
*A small project when I worked at my teacher's lab at HCMC University of Technology*
* **Time**: Sep 2019 - Oct 2019
* **Description**: I have applied some Image Processing Techniques in MATLAB to process Image and to create a new filter that can apply to some social applications like Instagram, Facebook.
* **Result**: These filters work perfectly. 
* **Language**: MATLAB

## LZW Image Compression Technique
* **Time**: Oct 2019 - Nov 2019
* **Role**: Leader, Algorithm Developer, Programming
* **Description**: This was my project with 2 classmates in the course "Digital Image Processing". Our work was developing and programming the LZW Image (Data) Compression Technique using Python.
* **Result**: A program that could compress the image for easier transmission.
* **Language**: Python.

## Bottle - Checking 
*Our team's final project in Computer Vision classes*
* **Time**: Sep 2019 -- Dec 2019
* **Role**: Member of a team of 4 members, in which, I were responsible for building algorithms and theory.
* **Description**: The aim of the project was to construct a system that could check whether the labels and the liquid level of the product are qualified or not. The project included Image Processing and some Machine Learning techniques such as Otsu Thresholding, Object detection, etc.
* **Result**: The system was able to check the labels and the liquid level corectly. 
* **Language**: Python.

## Image Super - Resolution using Deep Learning Techniques
*Major Project - Bachelor thesis*
* **Time**: Jan 2020 - now
* **Description**: The aim is using Deep Learning networks, techniques in Image Super - Resolution problems (how to create a new image with high resolution from a low resolution counterpart). Beside, I am still working on it to find out a new way to improve the networks based on some examples that have been published online
* **Result**: Until now: I have used GAN network to solve the problem and the network shows good performance. 
* **Language**: Python + PyTorch.
