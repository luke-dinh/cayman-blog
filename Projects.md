## Object-Detection Network Compression
*Conducted at Cyber Core when I were a machine-learning engineer*
* **Time**: Jun 2019 -- now
* **Role**: Member of a team of 6 members, in which, I were responsible for reading and implementing recent papers.
* **Description**: We have researched techniques to compress a powerful network to a tiny one with 8% of the original GFLOPs without sacrificing the original accuracy. This project is a contract between [Cyber Core](http://cybercore.co.jp/) and [Toyota Research Institute Advanced Development](https://www.tri-ad.global/) for building a module in autonomous cars.
* **Result**: Network architecture was designed that meets two criteria of GFLOPs and accuracy. A final quantization step is being conducted.

## Image Forgery Classification and Segmentation: A Unified Deep-Learning Approach
*Bachelor thesis*
* **Time**: Jan 2019 – Jun 2019
* **Role**: Leader of a team with two members.
* **Description**: We proposed a unified deep-learning network which can perform classification and segmentation simultaneously. Besides, we also derived a loss function
for overcoming data imbalance.
* **Result**: In comparison, there are two tasks. The proposed method surpasses recent methods (up to 2018) for 3/5 public datasets on task1, and 5/5 public datasets on task2.

## Pornographic Activity Detection
*Conducted at Zalo AILab when I were a data-mining collaborator*
* **Time**: Mar 2018 – May 2019
* **Role**: Main contributor (e.g., collecting data, organizing data, training model, deploying model, evaluating model).
* **Description**: I had built up a pipeline, including image-classification network, text-detection network, OCR network, and text-classification model, to detect users who were carrying out pornographic activities on Zalo.
* **Result**: The pipeline has been deployed live in Zalo.
